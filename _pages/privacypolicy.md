# Privacy Policy

## Debugging Data
We use Appleâ€™s opt-in service for crash reporting. Your device model, iOS version, the date that the crash occurred and any other crash data that Apple's crash reporting service makes available to us, will be viewable by us. You can find their privacy policy [here](https://www.apple.com/uk/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

This is purely for the purpose of tracking down bugs and we cannot view any data that you entered into the app.

## Personal Data
Nothing. We just can't.

Anything you enter in Timewave, is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to us.
We would not want our privacy violated and that's exactly what we want for our users as well. 

## Any Questions?
If you have any questions or considerations, please [get in touch.](mailto:mdsahilak.dev@gmail.com)
